The already constructed commercial assets such as shops and\n          halls are giving some revenue in the shape of rent etc. To augment its\n          revenue the SDA ha constructed commercial complex at M.A Road, named\n          as “Sangarmaal”. The Ist phase of the prestigious commercial complex\n          has been completed. The shops have been put to auction and presently\n          the Mall is functional. The complex will not only generate revenue for\n          SDA but will be synthesis of cultural and economic integration. Craft\n          Bazar being part of the complex symbolizes the historical tradition of\n          Kashmiri Art and Craft. The “Sangarmaal” is also unique and first\n          experience of modern marketing in the valley.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The SDA has already constructed commercial complexes at various places\n          and alotted the shops/commercial spaces to general public through\n          auction. Commercial complexes viz; Iqbal Shopping Complexes at old\n          Charisharief Adda, Jehlum Plaza/ Doodganga Shopping Complex, double\n          storeyed shopline at Batamaloo, Yemberzal Mall at Court Road, Srinagar\n          are few of the commercial assets of SDA that are functional at\n          present. Morever, recently a three storeyed shopline stands completed\n          at Bemina opposite SKIMS Hospital Bemina, Srinagar. The shops/spaces\n          have been auctioned/alloted to the general public.\n        </p>\n\n        <Header as=\"h4\">Community Halls</Header>\n        <p>\n          The SDA feels that apart from commercial and developmental activity,\n          it has social commitment as well. Many of the families of Srinagar\n          city are not in a position to accommodate their ceremonies due to the\n          dearth of space, Lower & Middle Income Groups suffer more on this\n          count. To mitigate this problem, the SDA proposed to construct\n          Community Halls. Two Community Halls have been constructed at Rajuri\n          Kadal and Bemina and the same are being used by the public. Morever,\n          one more community hall has been constructed at Gonikhan Srinagar.The\n          hall has been completed and commissioned. The SDA will identify more\n          slots particularly in down town city to construct more community halls\n          which shall be equipped with all facilities to perform the ceremonies\n          like marriages.These shall have provision for Guest Rooms, Waza Shed\n          small scientific slaughter room and parking facility. Provision for\n          water supply/sanitation and electrification are in built in the\n          projects itself in next phase.Apart from that SDA has constructed a\n          Guest House near its office Complex at Bemina.\n        </p>\n      </Container>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
