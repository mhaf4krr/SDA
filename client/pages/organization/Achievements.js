          Srinagar Development Authority was created with main objectives to
          bring a positive change of Srinagar city as per the prospective
          /spatial plans. The first and foremost responsibility of Srinagar Dev.
          Authority is to prepare and implement “master Plan” for the city of
          Srinagar. SDA has prepared Master Plans first in the year 1971 and
          IInd in the year 2000. IInd Master Plan was for a period of 20 years
          .It has however been reviewed mid way and new Master Plan 2015-2035
          stands approved recently. The Authority is looking after the issuance
          of building permissisons and NOCs as per the Srinagar Master Plan. The
          BOCA (Building Operation Controlling Authority) of SDA is functional
          and issues online building permissions and NOCs without any delay. The
          SDA is in the process of making zonal plans with the help of GIS
          software.
        </p>

        <Header as="h4">Urban Transport</Header>

        <p>
          The SDA has focused its attention on Urban transportation. The traffic
          pressure on roads has made transport services irritating for the
          general public. Not only the passengers are facing heat of
          un-comfortable passenger service but slow movement of goods in the
          city is also hampering the economic growth. To improve passenger
          service as well as goods movement, the SDA has already taken up the
          implementation of Master Plan in traffic and tansport sector.
          Following projects have been implemented.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The SDA has developed Regional Bus Stand at panthachowk for south
            bound traffic consisting of terminal building, passenger waithing
            sheds, offices and other related facilities over a land measuring
            approximately 250 kanals.
          </li>

          <li>
            The SDA has developed the Sumo/Taxi Stand at various places like;
            Panthachowk, Mini Bus Stand Bemina, Soura,Harwan Parimpora and
            Batamaloo.
          </li>

          <li>
            To ease out the pressure of goods laden trucks on the roads of CBD
            and surrounding areas, the Srinagar Development Authority earmarked
            the land approximately 200 kanals in parimpora adjacent to Fruit
            Mandi. All the goods and Forwarding Agencies in the Srinagar City
            have been shifted to the said place, thus removing much of the
            inconvenience to the General Public. The area needs to be developed
            by way of drains, roads and other facilities.
          </li>

          <li>
            With the tremendous increase in the traffic and also due to rise in
            the population of small cars, the parking in the city centres has
            now become a greater challenge to different agencies particularly
            traffic police. To provide parking facilities in the city
            particularly in the business and economic hubs of Budshahchowk,
            Lalchowk and its surrounding areas, the SDA has developed surface
            parking places at Sherwani Road in between SBI and Ahdoos Hotel,
            Poloview, Residency Road, Nehru Park, Baka Masjid Batamaloo and
            Meerakh Shah parking area.
          </li>

          <li>
            A mechanized multilevel parking for 286 cars has been developed at
            old KMD which is operational. In addition to this two number ramp
            type multilevel parkings one at old SMG having a capacity of 467
            cars and 130 two wheelers and other at Sheikhbagh having a capacity
            of 430 cars and 50 two-wheelers being developed under AMRUT mission.
            The work on both the projects is in progress.
          </li>

          <li>
            SDA is developing a cycle track with jogging track in Bemina under
            AMRUT mission. The work is in progress.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <Header as="h4">Housing Colonies</Header>
        <p>
          With the day to day increase in the population and migration of rural
          population to Urban Areas particularly in Srinagar City has put lot of
          pressure on the City. To de-congest the populated areas of Srinagar
          City and also to ease the pressure of inflow of rural migration, the
          SDA has formulated Housing Colony. The SDA has already developed
          Housing Colonies for ‘High Income Group’ (HIG), Middle Income
          Group(MIG), LIG,EWS at Bemina, Srinagar.The SDA has also developed
          Housing Colonies at Noorbagh and Sumerbugh for rehabilitation of
          dislocated families of River Jehlum. The Colonies are under the
          process of up gradation. Similarly SDA has constructed Gulposh
          Apartments consisting of 32 flats at Bemina in phase-Ist and 60 flats
          in Phase-2nd. The allotment process stands completed. Keeping in tune
          with the fast-changing urban landscape of Srinagar and mounting stress
          on its scarce land resources, SDA has embarked upon the ambitious
          initiative of exploring trans-formative and sustainable solution for
          affordable housing in the city by pioneering the concept of vertical
          colonies with integrated community facilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          What SDA strives to explore in this new initiative is to make people
          realize the dream of owning a secure, compact and affordable home in
          Srinagar and facilitate them to relocate with fast-changing housing
          needs without occupying as much land resources as the traditional
          houses do. Given the mounting demand for flat-type housing in Srinagar
          and to carry forward the pioneering concept of constructing integrated
          vertical housing colonies, SDA has earmarked around 89 kanals of land
          in the existing Mini Housing Colony, opposite Hajj House Bemina, for
          construction of more than 600 residential flats under the banner of
          Shehjar Apartments for which the work for five blocks (2 2BHK and 3
          3BHK) is in progress. Each tower consists of 28 flats, with stilt
          parking, 2 lifts and 2 stair cases. The flats will have gated entry
          from Bemina by-pass .
        </p>

        <p>
          A Dream Project of “Satellite Township” complete in all respects at
          Rakh Gund Aksha shall be SDA’s star project.4200 kanals of land stands
          already transferred to SDA by the Government. After removing the
          initial hitches/difficulties. The SDA has already filled a patch of
          land which has been acquired out of 4200 kanals.
        </p>

        <Header as="h4">Developmental of Institutional Areas</Header>

        <p>
          Certain offices within main city were also contributing to congestion
          and traffic jamming. The SDA in order to ease pressure on the city
          roads proposed and developed office complexes outside congested areas.
          To start with, SDA constructed its own office building outside city at
          Bemina and nearby to its offices, beautiful buildings/Secrecy Block
          building for Board of School Education at Bemina were constructed by
          SDA office building for Directorate of Economics and Statistics and
          Ecology and Environment had already been constructed by SDA at
          Bemina,Srinagar. The Habitat Complex at Bemina has been constructed
          and commissioned to accommodate the offices of Town Planning
          Organization(TPO), Architect Organization(AO), Urban Development
          Agency, Kashmir (UDAK), Housing Board and Urban Local Bodies.
        </p>

        <Header as="h4">Commercial Activity</Header>

        <p>
          The SDA is self funded organization. It has to generate its own
          revenues. The already constructed commercial assets such as shops and
          halls are giving some revenue in the shape of rent etc. To augment its
          revenue the SDA ha constructed commercial complex at M.A Road, named
          as “Sangarmaal”. The Ist phase of the prestigious commercial complex
          has been completed. The shops have been put to auction and presently
          the Mall is functional. The complex will not only generate revenue for
          SDA but will be synthesis of cultural and economic integration. Craft
          Bazar being part of the complex symbolizes the historical tradition of
          Kashmiri Art and Craft. The “Sangarmaal” is also unique and first
          experience of modern marketing in the valley.
        </p>

        <p>
          The SDA has already constructed commercial complexes at various places
          and alotted the shops/commercial spaces to general public through
          auction. Commercial complexes viz; Iqbal Shopping Complexes at old
          Charisharief Adda, Jehlum Plaza/ Doodganga Shopping Complex, double
          storeyed shopline at Batamaloo, Yemberzal Mall at Court Road, Srinagar
          are few of the commercial assets of SDA that are functional at
          present. Morever, recently a three storeyed shopline stands completed
          at Bemina opposite SKIMS Hospital Bemina, Srinagar. The shops/spaces
          have been auctioned/alloted to the general public.
        </p>

        <Header as="h4">Community Halls</Header>
        <p>
          The SDA feels that apart from commercial and developmental activity,
          it has social commitment as well. Many of the families of Srinagar
          city are not in a position to accommodate their ceremonies due to the
          dearth of space, Lower & Middle Income Groups suffer more on this
          count. To mitigate this problem, the SDA proposed to construct
          Community Halls. Two Community Halls have been constructed at Rajuri
          Kadal and Bemina and the same are being used by the public. Morever,
          one more community hall has been constructed at Gonikhan Srinagar.The
          hall has been completed and commissioned. The SDA will identify more
          slots particularly in down town city to construct more community halls
          which shall be equipped with all facilities to perform the ceremonies
          like marriages.These shall have provision for Guest Rooms, Waza Shed
          small scientific slaughter room and parking facility. Provision for
          water supply/sanitation and electrification are in built in the
          projects itself in next phase.Apart from that SDA has constructed a
          Guest House near its office Complex at Bemina.
