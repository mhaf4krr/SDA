        The Master Plan-2035 is a comprehensive public policy document
        calibrated to ground realities. The plan is at a departure from archaic
        planning efforts in terms of its public policy approach, development
        regulations, implementation mechanism, resource mobilisation, mixed
        landuse regulations etc. The Master Plan has been prepared for a
        threshold population of around three million by 2035 spread over an area
        of 766 Sq. Km. The Srinagar Metropolitan Planning limits have been
        increased from 416 Sq. Km to approximately 766 Sq. Km., i.e.; 84%
        increase. The Local Area of SDA stands already notified vide SRO-429
        dated 21.10.2014 (including the municipal areas of Srinagar Municipal
        Corporation and that of Budgam, Ganderbal, Pampore and Khrew ULBs and
        additional 160 villages as outgrowths in twelve tehsils of Six districts
        viz; Srinagar, Budgam, Ganderbal, Pulwama, Bandipora and Baramula).
