          The Master Plan-2035 is a comprehensive public policy document
          calibrated to ground realities. The plan is at a departure from
          archaic planning efforts in terms of its public policy approach,
          development regulations, implementation mechanism, resource
          mobilisation, mixed landuse regulations etc. The Master Plan has been
          prepared for a threshold population of around three million by 2035
          spread over an area of 766 Sq. Km. The Srinagar Metropolitan Planning
          limits have been increased from 416 Sq. Km to approximately 766 Sq.
          Km., i.e.; 84% increase. The Local Area of SDA stands already notified
          vide SRO-429 dated 21.10.2014 (including the municipal areas of
          Srinagar Municipal Corporation and that of Budgam, Ganderbal, Pampore
