            Housing : In view of huge  gap in demand and supply, the price of land  has gone terribly high and the residents of the city especially  the economically  the weaker  section, Low Income Groups and even the Middle Income Groups  are unable to purchase the land in the open market . Besides, the land purchased in open market is  undeveloped  without any basic infrastructure like roads, drains, water supply, electric infrastructure and sanitation and finally  the State Government provides  the infrastructure in these areas  at the cost of other  major infrastructure of the state. The  supply and  demand gap has also lead to encroachment   on River and Nallah  Banks and other State Lands including greenbelts  and water  bodies.
